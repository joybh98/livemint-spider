# Mint Scraper

* This is a simple web scraping and sentiment analysis project that I've picked up in my free time.

## Steps/Workflow
1. Takes input from user for the category of headlines it wants (news,companies etc). See livemint.com for all the sections/categories
2. Extracts the headlines, descriptions and urls of each article
3. Calculates the sentiment for each headline and shows it to the user.
